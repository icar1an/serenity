# Serenity

Serenity is an open-source browser extension designed to filter AI-generated and low-effort content on YouTube. By leveraging community-driven classifications, Serenity helps you maintain a high-quality viewing experience by automatically hiding channels that primarily produce AI-generated videos.

# Server

The backend infrastructure is built on Supabase, providing a robust and scalable platform for community classifications.

To ensure the longevity of the project, classification data is regularly backed up and community-accessible.

# API

Documentation for the Serenity API is available in our developer resources.

# Building
